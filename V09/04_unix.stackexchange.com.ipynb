In this  instance, software developers have access to the test release directory. It is theirs to muck with. They can work in that directory, push, pull, install in the virtual environment etc.  The problem comes when they copy things in from another area they have been working in, and their umasks are not set with group permissions.  It is confusing to them because file creation and copy by tar works fine.  It is also funny that I have to give them a copy script that just does what cp does.

My current status (still working on it): It seems that there is a 6 levels hierarchy of \"shell expansion\" (from `brace expansion` thru to `pathname expansion`). I can therefore understand that the example of `files=(*)` does not go through `word splitting`. However, it seems to me that the `pathname expansion` somehow internally(?) delimits the filenames by some other means than a space, because to my understanding the array asignment () would produce 4 items.. so is there some *special* interaction happening with these file-expansion words? This may be at the core of my puzzle.   |2011-03-12 04:23:18.567|\n",
